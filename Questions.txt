November 15th:
--------------
Given an array arr[] of distinct elements, the task is to count the total number of distinct pairs in which at least one element is prime.

Input 1: arr[] = {1, 3, 10, 7, 8}
Output: 7
Pairs with at least one prime are 
(1, 3), (1, 7), (3, 10), (3, 7), (3, 8), (10, 7), (7, 8).

Input 2: arr[]={4, 6, 8, 2, 9};
Output: 4
Pairs with at least one prime are
(4,2), (6,2), (8,2), (2,9)

-------------
Given a sorted array, A ,with possibly duplicated elements, find the indices of first and last occurences of a target element, x. Return -1 if target is not found.

Input: A = [1,3,3,5,7,8,9,9,9,15], target = 9
Output: [6,8]

Input: A = [100, 150, 150, 153], target = 150
Output: [1,2]

Input: A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,10], target = 9
Output: [-1, -1]

November 17th
-------------
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Input: nums = [10,10,20,20,30,30,40,40,50,50],
Output: length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 respectively.

--------------
a) Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Input: 1534236469
Output: 0

Input: -123
Output: -321

Input: 120
Output: 21

Input: -1463847412
output: -2147483641

Input: 1463847412
output: 2147483641

b)Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
Note:you have to do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]

November 19th
--------------
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Input: "jbpnbwwd"
output: 4 (jbpn)

November 20th
--------------
Given a string and a pattern, find the number of occurrences of the pattern in the given string along with the start index
Input :
String : GHJASDGHEFJTGHJ , Pattern : GHJ
Output : 
Ocurrences : 2 ; 
Start indices : 0 and 12

November 21st
--------------
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""

November 22nd:
---------------
Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.
Assume S consists of only lowercase letters.

Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  
The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".


November 23th:
--------------
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

Note:
The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
